#  885. Spiral Matrix III

# You start at the cell (rStart, cStart) of an rows x cols grid facing east.
# The northwest corner is at the first row and column in the grid, and the southeast corner is at the last row and column.

# You will walk in a clockwise spiral shape to visit every position in this grid.
# Whenever you move outside the grid's boundary, we continue our walk outside the grid (but may return to the grid boundary later.).
# Eventually, we reach all rows * cols spaces of the grid.

# Return an array of coordinates representing the positions of the grid in the order you visited them.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: rows = 1, cols = 4, rStart = 0, cStart = 0
# Output: [[0,0],[0,1],[0,2],[0,3]]
# Example 2:
# https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/08/24/example_2.png

# Input: rows = 5, cols = 6, rStart = 1, cStart = 4
# Output: [[1,4],[1,5],[2,5],[2,4],[2,3],[1,3],[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[3,5],[3,4],[3,3],[3,2],[2,2],[1,2],[0,2],[4,5],[4,4],[4,3],[4,2],[4,1],[3,1],[2,1],[1,1],[0,1],[4,0],[3,0],[2,0],[1,0],[0,0]]
